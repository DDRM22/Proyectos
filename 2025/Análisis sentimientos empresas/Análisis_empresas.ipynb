AFH provide ongoing product knowledge refresher training, So, if something doesn't 'click' the first time around, you may well understand it much better after having some hands on experience in your new role & sitting in the refresher training session again.\r\n- Knowing that through my work I'm able to assist other people, whether that's clients, co-workers, the advisers, supervisors or management; providing information needed and answering questions - to me that is the one of the biggest pros, job satisfaction.\r\n- Knowing that management trust me to use my own initiative to create & implement new strategies whilst working on large projects.\r\n- There are great possibilities of advancing your career and moving within the business.\r\n- Management acknowledging your efforts and going out of their way to thank you when you have worked hard.\r\n- Treated with respect and kindness & feel valued as an employee. \r\n- Fast-paced environment, never a dull moment and the time at work flies by!\r\n- Great benefits package.\r\n- Supportive and friendly co-workers.\r\n- Lovely office building to work in.\r\n- The list of pros could go on & on... but I'd be here all day.

         "I genuinely believe AFH have a good offering for clients and try to put their best interests at the heart of the business decisions however in doing so they have completely forgotten about the staff who are the people that provide that back office service to clients. If your staff are happy, feel well cared for, listened to and fairly remunerated for what they do then they will respect the company and want to deliver a service to the best of their ability. If you don’t do these things, which unfortunately is the case at AFH, the reverse is true. They focus too much on ‘cheap labour’ and harbour an atmosphere of ‘us and them’ between senior management and staff. I genuinely believe the CEO wants to do right by the staff but he is surrounded by yes people who shelter him from what’s really happening on the office floor. They don’t look after their own, people who have been loyal to the company for many years, other than those who have made it to a seat at the board table. When it comes to promotions, they prefer to recruit externally rather than those with experience who have worked their way through the ranks which is often a cause of frustration for staff who keep being promised their next promotion is just around the corner. HR is a shambles and you wouldn’t want to tell them anything remotely confidential otherwise it’s round the office as gossip in no time at all. They certainly don’t want people who will challenge the order of things or suggest a new way of thinking. It is a shame as I think the company has a lot of potential but unfortunately, despite beating you over the head about being ‘the employer of choice’, right now they are anything but. The company is growing rapidly but unless they do something soon about the multitude of unhappy staff (I interacted with all the departments in the business and almost every single person felt the same way), the entire back office support system will collapse and they won’t have any long term, knowledgeable or experienced staff to hold the business up."

The below is a list of the benefits to me personally, and is not exhaustive.\r\n\r\n-Scope for career progression to those that demonstrate the hunger and the skills required. It must be noted that you need to be realistic with your ambitions and a career is a career and not an overnight process. AFH reward loyalty, and if you demonstate the right abilities and attributes for more senior positions, combined with becoming an experienced team member and obtaining any examinations (if required), you will find yourself climbing up the career progression scale and experience the benefits that come with that increased responsibility. \r\n-Full financial support for relevant examinations which are approved by your line manager. I have had many exams and material paid for over the years which has supported me a lot and has always been fully appreciated. \r\n-The staff. Amazing, friendly people throughout the business and many friends for life who I have met through working there both past and present workers. This makes a working day so much better when you have good people around you.\r\n-Package aside from salary includes pension, a reasonable amount of healthcare (primarily dental and optical) and an annual bonus. There have been sweeteners in the past e.g. share options which for a growing company can be extremely lucrative. There is also a really attractive tiered loyalty bonus scheme which if in it for the long haul can be very welcoming. \r\n-Social aspect is really good. Christmas party, summer ball, summer BBQ, and annual charity football match to name a few.\r\n-AFH sponsor a charity each year and there are many interesting events throughout the year which staff are invited to join in on from conquering Snowdon, running in Birmingham 10k, skydives, pub quiz or just good old bake offs.\r\n-Compressed working pattern offered to certain workers (not all). A benefit I consume and it’s something that is not easy to put a price on. A working week compressed into 4 days allowing for the same rate of pay, but 3 days off in a working week instead of 2. Something I put a high value on personally.",

Most people there will hinder your career as opposed to progress it as it is a vindictive and malicious environment. The salary accross the board is undesirable in that 2 people could be doing the same role and the favoured party will be paid considerably more as they are a 'yes person' and most likely affraid to challenge for positive and productive outcomes. Contempt breeds with endless gossip. \r\nThe investment ethos also leaves a lot to be desired and many other investment companies in the midlands have better returns in comparison and therefore are better businesses in practice.\r\nThe position that I carried out allowed me to gain knowledge of the business and its employees from a higher level of access and I am qualified to say that my comments are knowledgable and accurate.\r\nAvoid AFH if you want to progress fairly and be rewarded for your hard work."

There is a good positive atmosphere at AFH and you are actively encouraged to talk openly about any issues including with the CEO. The benefits package is good but just as important, you are made to feel valued and recognised for a job well done.

         "Great Experience for 18months - 2 years if straight out of school/university and looking for a career in Financial Services. If you're lucky enough to get a parking spot in town (waiting list) - this is the most valuable benefit on offer (no really - financially the parking space is worth more than the pension). Easy life if you live locally.",
         "Pay in the Tunbridge Wells office matches the pay in the Manchester office so is CONSIDERABLY below market. I TRIPLED my salary within a year of leaving. Progression is limited and there is rampant favouritism and cronyism. No Salary bands are provided either so there is severe opaqueness in pay structure, which inevitably leads to huge turnover (over 30% in 2014, I believe) when people do learn of colleague's salaries.\r\n\r\nThe benefits, particularly the pension (3% matched - which by the way will be mandatory for all firms in 2018), are so terrible such that tea-making facilities are listed as a benefit on the employment contract. Ironic how bad the pension is, given that pensions form a large part of business. Other benefits: Death in Service (but only 3x). Town centre car parking, but there is waiting list of around a year. That's it.\r\n\r\nThey do offer to pay for training for the most basic qualification (the IOC), but very inflexible for additional training. They refused to allow me take time off for to do the study course for highly recognised CISI Diploma even though, because they refused to pay for it, I had forked out £1500 for it. They insisted time off for study come out of holiday!\r\n\r\nMassive dislocation between the Tunbridge Wells (TW) and Manchester (HQ) offices. TW office ignored by the head honchos in Manchester as a satellite office, but still didn't have any autonomy (there was no single individual in charge of the 120+ staff at the TW office). Very disjointed management structures. HR were very disinterested and Senior Management are worse. When there were three consecutive years of poor results on the annual Times Best Companies survey - management told the junior staff and team leaders to identify the specific issues causing the disgruntlement, work out some solutions and report their findings to management (to implement, if they felt like it). Senior  Management didn't get involved until all the work had aleady been done!\r\n\r\nThere were also a lot of recurring problems,e.g. Data Protection Breaches that were being reported to the Board on a monthly basis, but the Board rarely, if ever, did anything about them. There was no top-down reinforcement of culture as the Board had no interest in the day-to-day running of what is still quite a small business, nor the staff."

I work in admin and although I have 8 years previous experience working within an admin based role prior to starting work at AFH, I had never worked within the finance industry - so there has been a lot to learn, but I have enjoyed learning something new every day!\r\n- Management enable new recruits to learn at their own pace and facilitate their own style of learning when training up new people for their role. AFH provide ongoing product knowledge refresher training, So, if something doesn't 'click' the first time around, you may well understand it much better after having some hands on experience in your new role & sitting in the refresher training session again.\r\n- Knowing that through my work I'm able to assist other people, whether that's clients, co-workers, the advisers, supervisors or management; providing information needed and answering questions - to me that is the one of the biggest pros, job satisfaction.\r\n- Knowing that management trust me to use my own initiative to create & implement new strategies whilst working on large projects.\r\n- There are great possibilities of advancing your career and moving within the business.\r\n- Management acknowledging your efforts and going out of their way to thank you when you have worked hard.\r\n- Treated with respect and kindness & feel valued as an employee. \r\n- Fast-paced environment, never a dull moment and the time at work flies by!\r\n- Great benefits package.\r\n- Supportive and friendly co-workers.\r\n- Lovely office building to work in.\r\n- The list of pros could go on & on... but I'd be here all day.

         "I genuinely believe AFH have a good offering for clients and try to put their best interests at the heart of the business decisions however in doing so they have completely forgotten about the staff who are the people that provide that back office service to clients. If your staff are happy, feel well cared for, listened to and fairly remunerated for what they do then they will respect the company and want to deliver a service to the best of their ability. If you don’t do these things, which unfortunately is the case at AFH, the reverse is true. They focus too much on ‘cheap labour’ and harbour an atmosphere of ‘us and them’ between senior management and staff. I genuinely believe the CEO wants to do right by the staff but he is surrounded by yes people who shelter him from what’s really happening on the office floor. They don’t look after their own, people who have been loyal to the company for many years, other than those who have made it to a seat at the board table. When it comes to promotions, they prefer to recruit externally rather than those with experience who have worked their way through the ranks which is often a cause of frustration for staff who keep being promised their next promotion is just around the corner. HR is a shambles and you wouldn’t want to tell them anything remotely confidential otherwise it’s round the office as gossip in no time at all. They certainly don’t want people who will challenge the order of things or suggest a new way of thinking. It is a shame as I think the company has a lot of potential but unfortunately, despite beating you over the head about being ‘the employer of choice’, right now they are anything but. The company is growing rapidly but unless they do something soon about the multitude of unhappy staff (I interacted with all the departments in the business and almost every single person felt the same way), the entire back office support system will collapse and they won’t have any long term, knowledgeable or experienced staff to hold the business up."

The company has been on an amazing growth journey, certainly since then which it has been a privilidge to be a part of. The below is a list of the benefits to me personally, and is not exhaustive.\r\n\r\n-Scope for career progression to those that demonstrate the hunger and the skills required. It must be noted that you need to be realistic with your ambitions and a career is a career and not an overnight process. AFH reward loyalty, and if you demonstate the right abilities and attributes for more senior positions, combined with becoming an experienced team member and obtaining any examinations (if required), you will find yourself climbing up the career progression scale and experience the benefits that come with that increased responsibility. \r\n-Full financial support for relevant examinations which are approved by your line manager. I have had many exams and material paid for over the years which has supported me a lot and has always been fully appreciated. \r\n-The staff. Amazing, friendly people throughout the business and many friends for life who I have met through working there both past and present workers. This makes a working day so much better when you have good people around you.\r\n-Package aside from salary includes pension, a reasonable amount of healthcare (primarily dental and optical) and an annual bonus. There have been sweeteners in the past e.g. share options which for a growing company can be extremely lucrative. There is also a really attractive tiered loyalty bonus scheme which if in it for the long haul can be very welcoming. \r\n-Social aspect is really good. Christmas party, summer ball, summer BBQ, and annual charity football match to name a few.\r\n-AFH sponsor a charity each year and there are many interesting events throughout the year which staff are invited to join in on from conquering Snowdon, running in Birmingham 10k, skydives, pub quiz or just good old bake offs.\r\n-Compressed working pattern offered to certain workers (not all). A benefit I consume and it’s something that is not easy to put a price on. A working week compressed into 4 days allowing for the same rate of pay, but 3 days off in a working week instead of 2. Something I put a high value on personally.",

Most people there will hinder your career as opposed to progress it as it is a vindictive and malicious environment. The salary accross the board is undesirable in that 2 people could be doing the same role and the favoured party will be paid considerably more as they are a 'yes person' and most likely affraid to challenge for positive and productive outcomes. Contempt breeds with endless gossip. \r\nThe investment ethos also leaves a lot to be desired and many other investment companies in the midlands have better returns in comparison and therefore are better businesses in practice.\r\nThe position that I carried out allowed me to gain knowledge of the business and its employees from a higher level of access and I am qualified to say that my comments are knowledgable and accurate.\r\nAvoid AFH if you want to progress fairly and be rewarded for your hard work."

         "Great Experience for 18months - 2 years if straight out of school/university and looking for a career in Financial Services. If you're lucky enough to get a parking spot in town (waiting list) - this is the most valuable benefit on offer (no really - financially the parking space is worth more than the pension). Easy life if you live locally.",
         "Pay in the Tunbridge Wells office matches the pay in the Manchester office so is CONSIDERABLY below market. I TRIPLED my salary within a year of leaving. Progression is limited and there is rampant favouritism and cronyism. No Salary bands are provided either so there is severe opaqueness in pay structure, which inevitably leads to huge turnover (over 30% in 2014, I believe) when people do learn of colleague's salaries.\r\n\r\nThe benefits, particularly the pension (3% matched - which by the way will be mandatory for all firms in 2018), are so terrible such that tea-making facilities are listed as a benefit on the employment contract. Ironic how bad the pension is, given that pensions form a large part of business. Other benefits: Death in Service (but only 3x). Town centre car parking, but there is waiting list of around a year. That's it.\r\n\r\nThey do offer to pay for training for the most basic qualification (the IOC), but very inflexible for additional training. They refused to allow me take time off for to do the study course for highly recognised CISI Diploma even though, because they refused to pay for it, I had forked out £1500 for it. They insisted time off for study come out of holiday!\r\n\r\nMassive dislocation between the Tunbridge Wells (TW) and Manchester (HQ) offices. TW office ignored by the head honchos in Manchester as a satellite office, but still didn't have any autonomy (there was no single individual in charge of the 120+ staff at the TW office). Very disjointed management structures. HR were very disinterested and Senior Management are worse. When there were three consecutive years of poor results on the annual Times Best Companies survey - management told the junior staff and team leaders to identify the specific issues causing the disgruntlement, work out some solutions and report their findings to management (to implement, if they felt like it). Senior  Management didn't get involved until all the work had aleady been done!\r\n\r\nThere were also a lot of recurring problems,e.g. Data Protection Breaches that were being reported to the Board on a monthly basis, but the Board rarely, if ever, did anything about them. There was no top-down reinforcement of culture as the Board had no interest in the day-to-day running of what is still quite a small business, nor the staff."

If you're lucky enough to get a parking spot in town (waiting list) - this is the most valuable benefit on offer (no really - financially the parking space is worth more than the pension). Easy life if you live locally.",
         "Pay in the Tunbridge Wells office matches the pay in the Manchester office so is CONSIDERABLY below market. I TRIPLED my salary within a year of leaving. Progression is limited and there is rampant favouritism and cronyism. No Salary bands are provided either so there is severe opaqueness in pay structure, which inevitably leads to huge turnover (over 30% in 2014, I believe) when people do learn of colleague's salaries.\r\n\r\nThe benefits, particularly the pension (3% matched - which by the way will be mandatory for all firms in 2018), are so terrible such that tea-making facilities are listed as a benefit on the employment contract. Ironic how bad the pension is, given that pensions form a large part of business. Other benefits: Death in Service (but only 3x). Town centre car parking, but there is waiting list of around a year. That's it.\r\n\r\nThey do offer to pay for training for the most basic qualification (the IOC), but very inflexible for additional training. They refused to allow me take time off for to do the study course for highly recognised CISI Diploma even though, because they refused to pay for it, I had forked out £1500 for it. They insisted time off for study come out of holiday!\r\n\r\nMassive dislocation between the Tunbridge Wells (TW) and Manchester (HQ) offices. TW office ignored by the head honchos in Manchester as a satellite office, but still didn't have any autonomy (there was no single individual in charge of the 120+ staff at the TW office). Very disjointed management structures. HR were very disinterested and Senior Management are worse. When there were three consecutive years of poor results on the annual Times Best Companies survey - management told the junior staff and team leaders to identify the specific issues causing the disgruntlement, work out some solutions and report their findings to management (to implement, if they felt like it). Senior  Management didn't get involved until all the work had aleady been done!\r\n\r\nThere were also a lot of recurring problems,e.g. Data Protection Breaches that were being reported to the Board on a monthly basis, but the Board rarely, if ever, did anything about them. There was no top-down reinforcement of culture as the Board had no interest in the day-to-day running of what is still quite a small business, nor the staff."

They were very good at passing the blame.\r\n- Certain procedures just add complication to the working environment. \r\n- Management were always pushing for workers to work overtime, even when the answer was a categorical no. \r\n- Always felt that management and section leaders were very judgemental and that there was a hidden motive.  \r\n- Very sloppy at making sure workers are 100% satisfied and happy, it took over two years to realise that someone had not actually been properly trained."

         "I genuinely believe AFH have a good offering for clients and try to put their best interests at the heart of the business decisions however in doing so they have completely forgotten about the staff who are the people that provide that back office service to clients. If your staff are happy, feel well cared for, listened to and fairly remunerated for what they do then they will respect the company and want to deliver a service to the best of their ability. If you don’t do these things, which unfortunately is the case at AFH, the reverse is true. They focus too much on ‘cheap labour’ and harbour an atmosphere of ‘us and them’ between senior management and staff. I genuinely believe the CEO wants to do right by the staff but he is surrounded by yes people who shelter him from what’s really happening on the office floor. They don’t look after their own, people who have been loyal to the company for many years, other than those who have made it to a seat at the board table. When it comes to promotions, they prefer to recruit externally rather than those with experience who have worked their way through the ranks which is often a cause of frustration for staff who keep being promised their next promotion is just around the corner. HR is a shambles and you wouldn’t want to tell them anything remotely confidential otherwise it’s round the office as gossip in no time at all. They certainly don’t want people who will challenge the order of things or suggest a new way of thinking. It is a shame as I think the company has a lot of potential but unfortunately, despite beating you over the head about being ‘the employer of choice’, right now they are anything but. The company is growing rapidly but unless they do something soon about the multitude of unhappy staff (I interacted with all the departments in the business and almost every single person felt the same way), the entire back office support system will collapse and they won’t have any long term, knowledgeable or experienced staff to hold the business up."

The company has been on an amazing growth journey, certainly since then which it has been a privilidge to be a part of. The below is a list of the benefits to me personally, and is not exhaustive.\r\n\r\n-Scope for career progression to those that demonstrate the hunger and the skills required. It must be noted that you need to be realistic with your ambitions and a career is a career and not an overnight process. AFH reward loyalty, and if you demonstate the right abilities and attributes for more senior positions, combined with becoming an experienced team member and obtaining any examinations (if required), you will find yourself climbing up the career progression scale and experience the benefits that come with that increased responsibility. \r\n-Full financial support for relevant examinations which are approved by your line manager. I have had many exams and material paid for over the years which has supported me a lot and has always been fully appreciated. \r\n-The staff. Amazing, friendly people throughout the business and many friends for life who I have met through working there both past and present workers. This makes a working day so much better when you have good people around you.\r\n-Package aside from salary includes pension, a reasonable amount of healthcare (primarily dental and optical) and an annual bonus. There have been sweeteners in the past e.g. share options which for a growing company can be extremely lucrative. There is also a really attractive tiered loyalty bonus scheme which if in it for the long haul can be very welcoming. \r\n-Social aspect is really good. Christmas party, summer ball, summer BBQ, and annual charity football match to name a few.\r\n-AFH sponsor a charity each year and there are many interesting events throughout the year which staff are invited to join in on from conquering Snowdon, running in Birmingham 10k, skydives, pub quiz or just good old bake offs.\r\n-Compressed working pattern offered to certain workers (not all). A benefit I consume and it’s something that is not easy to put a price on. A working week compressed into 4 days allowing for the same rate of pay, but 3 days off in a working week instead of 2. Something I put a high value on personally.",

Most people there will hinder your career as opposed to progress it as it is a vindictive and malicious environment. The salary accross the board is undesirable in that 2 people could be doing the same role and the favoured party will be paid considerably more as they are a 'yes person' and most likely affraid to challenge for positive and productive outcomes. Contempt breeds with endless gossip. \r\nThe investment ethos also leaves a lot to be desired and many other investment companies in the midlands have better returns in comparison and therefore are better businesses in practice.\r\nThe position that I carried out allowed me to gain knowledge of the business and its employees from a higher level of access and I am qualified to say that my comments are knowledgable and accurate.\r\nAvoid AFH if you want to progress fairly and be rewarded for your hard work."

If your staff are happy, feel well cared for, listened to and fairly remunerated for what they do then they will respect the company and want to deliver a service to the best of their ability. If you don’t do these things, which unfortunately is the case at AFH, the reverse is true. They focus too much on ‘cheap labour’ and harbour an atmosphere of ‘us and them’ between senior management and staff. I genuinely believe the CEO wants to do right by the staff but he is surrounded by yes people who shelter him from what’s really happening on the office floor. They don’t look after their own, people who have been loyal to the company for many years, other than those who have made it to a seat at the board table. When it comes to promotions, they prefer to recruit externally rather than those with experience who have worked their way through the ranks which is often a cause of frustration for staff who keep being promised their next promotion is just around the corner. HR is a shambles and you wouldn’t want to tell them anything remotely confidential otherwise it’s round the office as gossip in no time at all. They certainly don’t want people who will challenge the order of things or suggest a new way of thinking. It is a shame as I think the company has a lot of potential but unfortunately, despite beating you over the head about being ‘the employer of choice’, right now they are anything but. The company is growing rapidly but unless they do something soon about the multitude of unhappy staff (I interacted with all the departments in the business and almost every single person felt the same way), the entire back office support system will collapse and they won’t have any long term, knowledgeable or experienced staff to hold the business up."

         "Great place to have a career. I joined fresh out of university nearly 7 years ago. The company has been on an amazing growth journey, certainly since then which it has been a privilidge to be a part of. The below is a list of the benefits to me personally, and is not exhaustive.\r\n\r\n-Scope for career progression to those that demonstrate the hunger and the skills required. It must be noted that you need to be realistic with your ambitions and a career is a career and not an overnight process. AFH reward loyalty, and if you demonstate the right abilities and attributes for more senior positions, combined with becoming an experienced team member and obtaining any examinations (if required), you will find yourself climbing up the career progression scale and experience the benefits that come with that increased responsibility. \r\n-Full financial support for relevant examinations which are approved by your line manager. I have had many exams and material paid for over the years which has supported me a lot and has always been fully appreciated. \r\n-The staff. Amazing, friendly people throughout the business and many friends for life who I have met through working there both past and present workers. This makes a working day so much better when you have good people around you.\r\n-Package aside from salary includes pension, a reasonable amount of healthcare (primarily dental and optical) and an annual bonus. There have been sweeteners in the past e.g. share options which for a growing company can be extremely lucrative. There is also a really attractive tiered loyalty bonus scheme which if in it for the long haul can be very welcoming. \r\n-Social aspect is really good. Christmas party, summer ball, summer BBQ, and annual charity football match to name a few.\r\n-AFH sponsor a charity each year and there are many interesting events throughout the year which staff are invited to join in on from conquering Snowdon, running in Birmingham 10k, skydives, pub quiz or just good old bake offs.\r\n-Compressed working pattern offered to certain workers (not all). A benefit I consume and it’s something that is not easy to put a price on. A working week compressed into 4 days allowing for the same rate of pay, but 3 days off in a working week instead of 2. Something I put a high value on personally.",
         "I genuinely have no cons to working here. You get out what you put in. Over time, if you demonstate the right attributes, skills, attitude and work ethic this will be rewarded."

Most people there will hinder your career as opposed to progress it as it is a vindictive and malicious environment. The salary accross the board is undesirable in that 2 people could be doing the same role and the favoured party will be paid considerably more as they are a 'yes person' and most likely affraid to challenge for positive and productive outcomes. Contempt breeds with endless gossip. \r\nThe investment ethos also leaves a lot to be desired and many other investment companies in the midlands have better returns in comparison and therefore are better businesses in practice.\r\nThe position that I carried out allowed me to gain knowledge of the business and its employees from a higher level of access and I am qualified to say that my comments are knowledgable and accurate.\r\nAvoid AFH if you want to progress fairly and be rewarded for your hard work."

         "I genuinely believe AFH have a good offering for clients and try to put their best interests at the heart of the business decisions however in doing so they have completely forgotten about the staff who are the people that provide that back office service to clients. If your staff are happy, feel well cared for, listened to and fairly remunerated for what they do then they will respect the company and want to deliver a service to the best of their ability. If you don’t do these things, which unfortunately is the case at AFH, the reverse is true. They focus too much on ‘cheap labour’ and harbour an atmosphere of ‘us and them’ between senior management and staff. I genuinely believe the CEO wants to do right by the staff but he is surrounded by yes people who shelter him from what’s really happening on the office floor. They don’t look after their own, people who have been loyal to the company for many years, other than those who have made it to a seat at the board table. When it comes to promotions, they prefer to recruit externally rather than those with experience who have worked their way through the ranks which is often a cause of frustration for staff who keep being promised their next promotion is just around the corner. HR is a shambles and you wouldn’t want to tell them anything remotely confidential otherwise it’s round the office as gossip in no time at all. They certainly don’t want people who will challenge the order of things or suggest a new way of thinking. It is a shame as I think the company has a lot of potential but unfortunately, despite beating you over the head about being ‘the employer of choice’, right now they are anything but. The company is growing rapidly but unless they do something soon about the multitude of unhappy staff (I interacted with all the departments in the business and almost every single person felt the same way), the entire back office support system will collapse and they won’t have any long term, knowledgeable or experienced staff to hold the business up.",

         "Great place to have a career. I joined fresh out of university nearly 7 years ago. The company has been on an amazing growth journey, certainly since then which it has been a privilidge to be a part of. The below is a list of the benefits to me personally, and is not exhaustive.\r\n\r\n-Scope for career progression to those that demonstrate the hunger and the skills required. It must be noted that you need to be realistic with your ambitions and a career is a career and not an overnight process. AFH reward loyalty, and if you demonstate the right abilities and attributes for more senior positions, combined with becoming an experienced team member and obtaining any examinations (if required), you will find yourself climbing up the career progression scale and experience the benefits that come with that increased responsibility. \r\n-Full financial support for relevant examinations which are approved by your line manager. I have had many exams and material paid for over the years which has supported me a lot and has always been fully appreciated. \r\n-The staff. Amazing, friendly people throughout the business and many friends for life who I have met through working there both past and present workers. This makes a working day so much better when you have good people around you.\r\n-Package aside from salary includes pension, a reasonable amount of healthcare (primarily dental and optical) and an annual bonus. There have been sweeteners in the past e.g. share options which for a growing company can be extremely lucrative. There is also a really attractive tiered loyalty bonus scheme which if in it for the long haul can be very welcoming. \r\n-Social aspect is really good. Christmas party, summer ball, summer BBQ, and annual charity football match to name a few.\r\n-AFH sponsor a charity each year and there are many interesting events throughout the year which staff are invited to join in on from conquering Snowdon, running in Birmingham 10k, skydives, pub quiz or just good old bake offs.\r\n-Compressed working pattern offered to certain workers (not all). A benefit I consume and it’s something that is not easy to put a price on. A working week compressed into 4 days allowing for the same rate of pay, but 3 days off in a working week instead of 2. Something I put a high value on personally.",

Most people there will hinder your career as opposed to progress it as it is a vindictive and malicious environment. The salary accross the board is undesirable in that 2 people could be doing the same role and the favoured party will be paid considerably more as they are a 'yes person' and most likely affraid to challenge for positive and productive outcomes. Contempt breeds with endless gossip. \r\nThe investment ethos also leaves a lot to be desired and many other investment companies in the midlands have better returns in comparison and therefore are better businesses in practice.\r\nThe position that I carried out allowed me to gain knowledge of the business and its employees from a higher level of access and I am qualified to say that my comments are knowledgable and accurate.\r\nAvoid AFH if you want to progress fairly and be rewarded for your hard work.",

         "I genuinely believe AFH have a good offering for clients and try to put their best interests at the heart of the business decisions however in doing so they have completely forgotten about the staff who are the people that provide that back office service to clients. If your staff are happy, feel well cared for, listened to and fairly remunerated for what they do then they will respect the company and want to deliver a service to the best of their ability. If you don’t do these things, which unfortunately is the case at AFH, the reverse is true. They focus too much on ‘cheap labour’ and harbour an atmosphere of ‘us and them’ between senior management and staff. I genuinely believe the CEO wants to do right by the staff but he is surrounded by yes people who shelter him from what’s really happening on the office floor. They don’t look after their own, people who have been loyal to the company for many years, other than those who have made it to a seat at the board table. When it comes to promotions, they prefer to recruit externally rather than those with experience who have worked their way through the ranks which is often a cause of frustration for staff who keep being promised their next promotion is just around the corner. HR is a shambles and you wouldn’t want to tell them anything remotely confidential otherwise it’s round the office as gossip in no time at all. They certainly don’t want people who will challenge the order of things or suggest a new way of thinking. It is a shame as I think the company has a lot of potential but unfortunately, despite beating you over the head about being ‘the employer of choice’, right now they are anything but. The company is growing rapidly but unless they do something soon about the multitude of unhappy staff (I interacted with all the departments in the business and almost every single person felt the same way), the entire back office support system will collapse and they won’t have any long term, knowledgeable or experienced staff to hold the business up.",

The company has been on an amazing growth journey, certainly since then which it has been a privilidge to be a part of. The below is a list of the benefits to me personally, and is not exhaustive.\r\n\r\n-Scope for career progression to those that demonstrate the hunger and the skills required. It must be noted that you need to be realistic with your ambitions and a career is a career and not an overnight process. AFH reward loyalty, and if you demonstate the right abilities and attributes for more senior positions, combined with becoming an experienced team member and obtaining any examinations (if required), you will find yourself climbing up the career progression scale and experience the benefits that come with that increased responsibility. \r\n-Full financial support for relevant examinations which are approved by your line manager. I have had many exams and material paid for over the years which has supported me a lot and has always been fully appreciated. \r\n-The staff. Amazing, friendly people throughout the business and many friends for life who I have met through working there both past and present workers. This makes a working day so much better when you have good people around you.\r\n-Package aside from salary includes pension, a reasonable amount of healthcare (primarily dental and optical) and an annual bonus. There have been sweeteners in the past e.g. share options which for a growing company can be extremely lucrative. There is also a really attractive tiered loyalty bonus scheme which if in it for the long haul can be very welcoming. \r\n-Social aspect is really good. Christmas party, summer ball, summer BBQ, and annual charity football match to name a few.\r\n-AFH sponsor a charity each year and there are many interesting events throughout the year which staff are invited to join in on from conquering Snowdon, running in Birmingham 10k, skydives, pub quiz or just good old bake offs.\r\n-Compressed working pattern offered to certain workers (not all). A benefit I consume and it’s something that is not easy to put a price on. A working week compressed into 4 days allowing for the same rate of pay, but 3 days off in a working week instead of 2. Something I put a high value on personally.",

Most people there will hinder your career as opposed to progress it as it is a vindictive and malicious environment. The salary accross the board is undesirable in that 2 people could be doing the same role and the favoured party will be paid considerably more as they are a 'yes person' and most likely affraid to challenge for positive and productive outcomes. Contempt breeds with endless gossip. \r\nThe investment ethos also leaves a lot to be desired and many other investment companies in the midlands have better returns in comparison and therefore are better businesses in practice.\r\nThe position that I carried out allowed me to gain knowledge of the business and its employees from a higher level of access and I am qualified to say that my comments are knowledgable and accurate.\r\nAvoid AFH if you want to progress fairly and be rewarded for your hard work.",

There are a number of other pros for working for AFH such as:\r\n- discount at local gyms\r\n- Saving Schemes\r\n- family fun day bbqs\r\n- great atmosphere working the office\r\n- annual bonus\r\n- secure parking\r\n- payrise based on performance..\r\n...The list could go on!!\r\n\r\nRegularly throughout the year, the CEO and head of HR meet with a representative from each team in the Employee forum. They listen to ideas and ways to improve things from staff across the company. \r\nWe have an intranet which keeps us updated on the goings on from across the business. The CEO also carries out presentations to inform us of how we are performing and again a chance to ask any questions we may have.\r\n\r\nAll in all I really enjoy working for AFH!",

         "I genuinely believe AFH have a good offering for clients and try to put their best interests at the heart of the business decisions however in doing so they have completely forgotten about the staff who are the people that provide that back office service to clients. If your staff are happy, feel well cared for, listened to and fairly remunerated for what they do then they will respect the company and want to deliver a service to the best of their ability. If you don’t do these things, which unfortunately is the case at AFH, the reverse is true. They focus too much on ‘cheap labour’ and harbour an atmosphere of ‘us and them’ between senior management and staff. I genuinely believe the CEO wants to do right by the staff but he is surrounded by yes people who shelter him from what’s really happening on the office floor. They don’t look after their own, people who have been loyal to the company for many years, other than those who have made it to a seat at the board table. When it comes to promotions, they prefer to recruit externally rather than those with experience who have worked their way through the ranks which is often a cause of frustration for staff who keep being promised their next promotion is just around the corner. HR is a shambles and you wouldn’t want to tell them anything remotely confidential otherwise it’s round the office as gossip in no time at all. They certainly don’t want people who will challenge the order of things or suggest a new way of thinking. It is a shame as I think the company has a lot of potential but unfortunately, despite beating you over the head about being ‘the employer of choice’, right now they are anything but. The company is growing rapidly but unless they do something soon about the multitude of unhappy staff (I interacted with all the departments in the business and almost every single person felt the same way), the entire back office support system will collapse and they won’t have any long term, knowledgeable or experienced staff to hold the business up.",

The company has been on an amazing growth journey, certainly since then which it has been a privilidge to be a part of. The below is a list of the benefits to me personally, and is not exhaustive.\r\n\r\n-Scope for career progression to those that demonstrate the hunger and the skills required. It must be noted that you need to be realistic with your ambitions and a career is a career and not an overnight process. AFH reward loyalty, and if you demonstate the right abilities and attributes for more senior positions, combined with becoming an experienced team member and obtaining any examinations (if required), you will find yourself climbing up the career progression scale and experience the benefits that come with that increased responsibility. \r\n-Full financial support for relevant examinations which are approved by your line manager. I have had many exams and material paid for over the years which has supported me a lot and has always been fully appreciated. \r\n-The staff. Amazing, friendly people throughout the business and many friends for life who I have met through working there both past and present workers. This makes a working day so much better when you have good people around you.\r\n-Package aside from salary includes pension, a reasonable amount of healthcare (primarily dental and optical) and an annual bonus. There have been sweeteners in the past e.g. share options which for a growing company can be extremely lucrative. There is also a really attractive tiered loyalty bonus scheme which if in it for the long haul can be very welcoming. \r\n-Social aspect is really good. Christmas party, summer ball, summer BBQ, and annual charity football match to name a few.\r\n-AFH sponsor a charity each year and there are many interesting events throughout the year which staff are invited to join in on from conquering Snowdon, running in Birmingham 10k, skydives, pub quiz or just good old bake offs.\r\n-Compressed working pattern offered to certain workers (not all). A benefit I consume and it’s something that is not easy to put a price on. A working week compressed into 4 days allowing for the same rate of pay, but 3 days off in a working week instead of 2. Something I put a high value on personally.",

Most people there will hinder your career as opposed to progress it as it is a vindictive and malicious environment. The salary accross the board is undesirable in that 2 people could be doing the same role and the favoured party will be paid considerably more as they are a 'yes person' and most likely affraid to challenge for positive and productive outcomes. Contempt breeds with endless gossip. \r\nThe investment ethos also leaves a lot to be desired and many other investment companies in the midlands have better returns in comparison and therefore are better businesses in practice.\r\nThe position that I carried out allowed me to gain knowledge of the business and its employees from a higher level of access and I am qualified to say that my comments are knowledgable and accurate.\r\nAvoid AFH if you want to progress fairly and be rewarded for your hard work.",

         "I joined AFH in December 2017 and have found them to be a truly great company to work for. On week one meetings were arranged for me with all the Senior Managers from the various departments so I could understand the different parts of the business.  There is a good positive atmosphere at AFH and you are actively encouraged to talk openly about any issues including with the CEO. The benefits package is good but just as important, you are made to feel valued and recognised for a job well done. I work with many teams across AFH and find them to be helpful and generous with their time.  Good work / life balance is also very much in evidence.",
